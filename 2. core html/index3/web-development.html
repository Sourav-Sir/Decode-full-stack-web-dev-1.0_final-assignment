        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. It can range
            from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
            businesses, and social network services. It involves both frontend and backend development, and it's a
            constantly evolving field with new technologies emerging all the time.</p>
