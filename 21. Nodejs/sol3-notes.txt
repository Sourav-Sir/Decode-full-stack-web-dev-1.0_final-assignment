1. Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations in Node.js
Synchronous Operations:

Synchronous operations in Node.js are executed in a sequential order, blocking the execution of subsequent code until the current operation completes.
When a synchronous function is called, the program waits for it to finish before moving on to the next line of code.
This can lead to inefficiencies, especially for operations like I/O tasks (e.g., reading a file, making a network request) that take time, as it blocks the entire process.

Asynchronous Operations:

Asynchronous operations allow other code to execute while waiting for the operation to complete.
In Node.js, asynchronous functions typically use callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle the completion of the operation.
This non-blocking nature allows Node.js to handle many operations concurrently, making it highly efficient for I/O-bound tasks.

2. Create a Script That Reads a File Asynchronously and Logs Its Content
First, create a file named example.txt with some content that you want to read.
Hello, this is an example file content!

Now, create a script named readFileAsync.js to read this file asynchronously:

3. Use the Built-in fs Module to Handle File Reading
In the script above, the fs.readFile function from Node.js's built-in fs (File System) module is used to read the file asynchronously. The function takes three arguments:

The path to the file (example.txt).
The encoding (utf8), which ensures the file is read as a string.
A callback function that is called when the reading operation is completed.
Running the Code
To execute the script, run:

node readFileAsync.js

You should see output similar to:

File reading initiated...
File content: Hello, this is an example file content!
