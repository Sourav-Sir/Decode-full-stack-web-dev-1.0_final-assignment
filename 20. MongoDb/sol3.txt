1. Creating and Dropping a Database in MongoDB
Creating a Database:
In MongoDB, you don't explicitly create a database. Instead, you create a new database implicitly by adding data to it. When you first create a collection and insert documents into it, MongoDB creates the database for you. Here's the general process:

Connect to MongoDB using the mongo shell or a MongoDB client.
Switch to the new database using the use command. MongoDB will create the database if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
Create a collection and insert data to finalize the database creation.
Dropping a Database:
To drop a database, you can use the dropDatabase() method. This removes the database and all of its collections.

Here are the steps:

Connect to MongoDB using the mongo shell or a MongoDB client.
Switch to the database you want to drop using the use command.
Drop the database using the db.dropDatabase() method.


2. Script to Create a New Database Named shopDB
You can use the following script in the MongoDB shell to create a new database named shopDB:


// Connect to MongoDB (assuming you're using the mongo shell)
use shopDB; // This switches to shopDB. The database will be created if it doesn't exist.

// Create a collection and insert a document to finalize the creation of the database
db.products.insertOne({ name: "Sample Product", price: 100 });
3. Script to Drop the shopDB Database
To drop the shopDB database, use this script:


// Connect to MongoDB (assuming you're using the mongo shell)
use shopDB; // Switch to the shopDB database

// Drop the database
db.dropDatabase();
In both scripts, make sure you're connected to the MongoDB server and have the necessary permissions to create or drop databases.
