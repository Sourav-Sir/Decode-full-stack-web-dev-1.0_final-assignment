1. Creating and Dropping a Collection in MongoDB
Creating a Collection:
In MongoDB, you don't explicitly create a collection. Instead, MongoDB automatically creates a collection when you insert a document into it. Here's how it works:

Connect to MongoDB using the mongo shell or a MongoDB client.
Switch to the desired database using the use command. If the database does not exist, it will be created.
Insert a document into a collection. If the collection does not exist, MongoDB will create it for you.
Dropping a Collection:
To drop a collection, you use the drop() method. This removes the collection and all of its documents. Here’s how to do it:

Connect to MongoDB using the mongo shell or a MongoDB client.
Switch to the database containing the collection you want to drop using the use command.

Drop the collection using the db.collection.drop() method.

2. Script to Create a Collection Named products in the shopDB Database
Here’s a script to create a products collection in the shopDB database:


// Connect to MongoDB (assuming you're using the mongo shell)
use shopDB; // Switch to the shopDB database

// Insert a document into the products collection to create it
db.products.insertOne({ name: "Sample Product", price: 100 });
3. Script to Drop the products Collection from the shopDB Database
To drop the products collection, use this script:


// Connect to MongoDB (assuming you're using the mongo shell)
use shopDB; // Switch to the shopDB database

// Drop the products collection
db.products.drop();

In these scripts, make sure you’re connected to the MongoDB server and have the necessary permissions to create or drop collections.
